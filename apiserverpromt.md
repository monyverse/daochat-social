Build a GraphQL API server for this flutter mobile app using the folders, sub-folders and files for advanced context: built with Apollo Server 4, Fastify, TypeScript.Use Apollo Federation 2 for a supergraph Architecture Framework with rover cli and router. The application follows a modular architecture with separate concerns handled by different components. The Node.js application built with TypeScript, utilizing various libraries and frameworks such as Apollo Server, Fastify, GraphQL, TypeGraphQL, Mongoose, and Redis. It also integrates   Application Overview:  This application is a GraphQL API server built with Apollo Server and Fastify. It uses TypeGraphQL for defining GraphQL schemas and resolvers using TypeScript decorators. Mongoose is used as the Object Document Mapping (ODM) library for interacting with a MongoDB database. Redis is used for caching and real-time subscriptions with the help of the graphql-redis-subscriptions library. It also includes job queuing functionality using BullMQ. Architecture: The application follows a modern, modular architecture with separate concerns handled by different components. The main components are:  GraphQL API: The core of the application is the GraphQL API, which is built using Apollo Server and Fastify. It defines the GraphQL schema, resolvers, and other necessary configurations.  Database: The application uses MongoDB as the primary database, with Mongoose as the ODM layer for interacting with the database.  Caching and Real-Time Subscriptions: Redis is used for caching and real-time subscriptions, enabling efficient data retrieval and real-time updates for clients.  Job Queuing: BullMQ is integrated for handling asynchronous tasks and job queuing, allowing the application to offload long-running or resource-intensive tasks to a separate queue.  Utilities and Helpers: Various utility functions and helper modules are included to handle tasks like authentication, validation, and other common operations.
